# yandexLycFinalProject

This is my final project for the Yandex.Lyceum course. It is a simple shopping web app.
It includes a database, a flask backend, a REST API for modifying all the data, a user login system, and an HTML / JS / CSS frontend with bootstrap.
For now, it is possible to view goods, sort them by category, add, remove and edit goods (as admin) and make orders.
Editing orders, searching and other features are not currently available, but I'm working on it :)
Please note that there is no integration with a payment system, as this is a learning project more than a real website.

You may use, copy and edit all the code however you like.
